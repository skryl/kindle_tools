Summary

A set of scripts to supplement the kindle. ClipParser reads the clippings files
generated by the kindle, reformats them to something more readable and splits
them to multiple files based on user input. The kindlevert script takes a list
of html files or URLs and sanitizes them for better viewing on the Kindle.
